//Challenge Questions
//1) Filter all presidents, leaving only the Democratic ones

const Democratic = presidents.filter(function (president) {
  if (president.party <= "D") {
    return true;
  }
});

console.log(Democratic);

//2)Filter all presidents to leave only one term Republican presidents HINT use If statement

const Republican = presidents.filter(function (president) {
  if (president.terms <= 1 && president.party >= "R") {
    return true;
  }
});

console.log(Republican);

//3) return only the last three presidents

const lastThree = presidents;

console.table(lastThree);

//4) log all dems who served 2 terms. HINT use chain filter, filter and slice

const Democratic2 = presidents.filter(function (president) {
  if (president.terms >= 2 && president.party <= "D") {
    return true;
  }
});

console.log(Democratic2);

//BONUS write a script to check if LBJ was a 2 term president. IF he was then alert("LBJ served two terms") else alert "LBJ was one and done"
